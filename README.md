The basic premise of the game is that you are stranded on a small island with other players and must find ways to survive. The game play is similar to that of the Hunger Games series in that you must gather resources, build shelter, and defend yourself from other players. There are also “elements” in the game which can provide helpful or harmful effects. For example, there is an element called “fire” which can be used to cook food or to burn down buildings.
